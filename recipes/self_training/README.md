# [Self-Training for End-to-End Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09116)

## Abstract
We revisit self-training in the context of end-to-end speech recognition. We demonstrate that training with pseudo-labels can substantially improve the accuracy of a baseline model. Key to our approach are a strong baseline acoustic and language model used to generate the pseudo-labels, filtering mechanisms tailored to common errors from sequence-to-sequence models, and a novel ensemble approach to increase pseudo-label diversity. Experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show that with an ensemble of four models and label filtering, self-training yields a 33.9% relative improvement in WER compared with a baseline trained on 100 hours of labelled data in the noisy speech setting. In the clean speech setting, self-training recovers 59.3% of the gap between the baseline and an oracle model, which is at least 93.8% relatively higher than what previous approaches can achieve.

## Reproduction
Acoustic model configuration files are provided for each dataset to reproduce results from the paper (training and decoding steps).

Pretrained convolutional language models used in the paper are also included, as well as steps to generate the language model corpus used to train the language models and steps to reproduce acoustic model training.

**Training and decoding broadly follow the existing [TDS seq2seq recipes](https://github.com/flashlight/wav2letter/tree/master/recipes/seq2seq_tds/librispeech).**
